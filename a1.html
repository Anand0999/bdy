 <div style="text-align: center;">   <p>On this day, the world was gifted with your light 
    <br>

In this vast universe, I was chosen to walk beside you.
<br><br>
I pray for peace in your soul, light in your days,<br>

and a love that always finds you â€” even in your darkest hours.<br><br>


I will spend today, and all my days,<br>
loving you deeper, holding you closer,<br>
and cherishing every beautiful piece of who you are.<br><br>

Happy Birthday, my heart.<br>
You are my forever.<br>
